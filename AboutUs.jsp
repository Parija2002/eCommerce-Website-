			An e-commerce website, by definition, is a website that allows you to buy and sell tangible goods, digital products or services online.
		    Trade, be it barter exchange or buying and selling of goods and services has been prevalent for centuries. No one can be self-sufficient. And this brings out the need for demand and supply of goods and services.
			Transactions have been going on all over the world for centuries, locally, and across locations. Keeping the same concept in mind, now think electronic.
			However, also bear in mind that with the whole world going online, data privacy laws have become increasingly stringent.
